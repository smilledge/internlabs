      "description": "Aim: To develop a mobile software application that provides students with a dashboard to record, track and analyse their performance and progression toward QUT Graduate capability outcomes. Project Context: Many students complete their degree with a strong focus on the content they have covered during their degree. However the research suggests that employers are particularly interested in elements reflected in the QUT graduate capabilities framework such as teamwork, critical thinking and effective use of technology. Despite significant investment into the development of the graduate capability framework and the alignment of curriculum to the framework, its salience amongst students remains low."

We’re a billion dollar S+P 500 company offering solutions from Linux to middleware, storage to cloud, together with award-winning global customer support, consulting, and implementation services. Summary: Most widely-used approaches for handling java dependencies lead to applications which pull a large set of dependencies from third-party sources. There is no well-established mechanism for determining the complete set of dependencies used by a java software project, and no way of automatically determining whether any of these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities. The victims project aims to address this. It provides a public database of known-vulnerable JAR fingerprints, and tools for matching these fingerprints to an application's dependency tree at build time, via integration with tools like ant, maven and jenkins. We would like to extend this functionality to detect known vulnerable dependencies at runtime. This would be in the form of an RHQ plugin to scan deployed applications on application servers managed by RHQ. All the components being used are open source, and the RHQ plugin should be released as open source, with the intern credited as its primary author. Project name: Detecting vulnerable dependencies at runtime Responsibilities: *Develop an RHQ plugin for the victims project *Debug, test and document this plugin "
